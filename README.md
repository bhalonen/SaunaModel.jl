# SaunaModel
This package is estimate of how a lumped sum sauna would behave. 
Elements of the sauna include
- Fire
- Stove
- Water tank (effect of this on the system will be checked)
- Air (a "scorth" factor of thermal mass will be investigated as well)
- Walls

One early interesting note is how a sauna moves from radiative to convective heat transfer as it gets hotter.
