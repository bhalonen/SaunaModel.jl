# SaunaModel API

The sauna model api is fairly straight forward to use. An example json to submit as a job can be obtained by calling the ```get_default_scenario_json``` function. For example 
```@docs
get_default_scenario_json
```
Use these defaults as a guide to use the ```dictionary_api``` -- only one value, of the unit that was returned in ```get_default_scenario_json``` must be submitted.
```@docs
dictionary_api
```
