# SaunaModel API

The sauna model api is fairly straight forward to use. An example json to submit as a job can be obtained by calling the ```get_default_scenario_json``` function.
```@docs
get_default_scenario_json
```
Edit the default as needed, or use as a guide, and submit to ```json_api```.
```@docs
json_api
```
